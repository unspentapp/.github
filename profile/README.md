# 💸 Unspent: because money doesn't grow on trees! 🌳

Welcome to the Unspent project, where we're turning budgeting from a bore into a blast! 🎉

## 🚀 Our Mission

We're on a quest to create the ultimate budgeting app that's:

- 🏎️ Fast as lightning
- 😎 Cool as all of us
- 🧠 Smart enough to outsmart your spending habits

## 🤔 Why Unspent?

Because let's face it, most budgeting apps are about as exciting as watching paint dry. We're here to change that! With Unspent, you'll:

- 📊 Get a crystal-clear view of your finances
- ⚡ Add expenses faster than you can say "impulse purchase"
- 🎯 Set weekly budgets (because who can think a whole month ahead?)
- 🎓 Learn financial wisdom without falling asleep
